AI Assist Log (optional)

Tools used:
- ChatGPT (assistant) to help write and refine Python scripts, create README and reflection, and design the summarization fallback.
- Local testing in this environment to assemble and save files (no external web fetches performed here).

Prompts (examples):
1) "Help me write a Python script that reads a CSV of task logs and generates totals per user and per task_type, handles invalid data, and outputs summary CSVs." — used to produce analyze_logs.py.
2) "Create a script that reads URLs from a file, fetches each webpage, extracts title/meta and creates a short summary. If an AI API key isn't present, include a simple extractive summarizer." — used to produce scrape_summarize.py.
3) "Generate a README.md that explains how to run both Part A and Part B, dependencies, and assumptions." — used to produce README.md content.

Notes on usage:
- Prompts included desired file names and exact deliverables for the assessment.
- The assistant produced fully commented scripts; I reviewed and adjusted variable names and file paths where needed before saving files for submission.
